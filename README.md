# test_repo
Repo for testing communal functionality.

Please use the MP-Programming-Club GitHub to share code with one another. Perhaps it would be best to make a repo for each language, or each research group, or maybe even each person to share their code on.
Obviously, this GitHub being communal means I can't police how files are laid out so I am entrusting users to keep the space tidy.
